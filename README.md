# Custom-Cake-Ordering-System-for-Small-Bakeries
This is a simple Android app (built in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose) that lets customers design and request custom cakes via a guided form on their phone. It's not a full online shop – no payments or inventory – just a tool to organize requests and send them to you (the baker) via WhatsApp.
