# Custom-Cake-Ordering-System-for-Small-Bakeries
This is a simple Android app (built in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose) that lets customers design and request custom cakes via a guided form on their phone. It's not a full online shop – no payments or inventory – just a tool to organize requests and send them to you (the baker) via WhatsApp.
Project Description
This project involves the design and development of a mobile application called Custom Cake Ordering System for Small Bakeries, aimed at simplifying and improving the process of ordering custom-made cakes.
Small bakeries and home-based cake businesses commonly receive orders through phone calls, WhatsApp messages, and handwritten notes. These traditional methods often lead to challenges such as incomplete order details, confusion between multiple customer requests, wrong cake specifications (flavor, size, toppings, or message), and forgotten delivery or pickup dates. These problems reduce efficiency and may result in customer dissatisfaction and loss of income.
The proposed system provides a structured and user-friendly digital platform where customers can place their cake orders by filling out a guided order form. The application allows users to select cake flavor, size, filling, toppings, occasion, custom message, and pickup or delivery date. Customers also provide their contact information to ensure effective communication.
The system validates user inputs to ensure that all required information is provided before submitting the order. After completion, an order summary is generated and can be sent directly to the bakery via WhatsApp or phone call, ensuring that the baker receives clear and complete order details in a single organized format.
By automating and organizing the cake ordering process, the system reduces errors, saves time, and improves service delivery for small bakeries. It also enhances customer convenience by allowing them to place orders anytime and from any location. The application will be developed using Kotlin for the Android platform and will demonstrate key concepts such as user interface design, form validation, and mobile communication integration.
